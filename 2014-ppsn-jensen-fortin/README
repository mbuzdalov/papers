-----------------------------------------

This is an implementation of the non-dominated sorting procedure
as per the following paper:

Buzdalov M., Shalyto A.
A Provably Asymptotically Fast Version of the Generalized Jensen Algorithm for Non-dominated Sorting 
// Parallel Problem Solving from Nature XIII.
- 2015. - P. 528-537. - (Lecture Notes on Computer Science ; 8672)

The standalone source code in Java is available under Apache 2.0
license as "standalone/FasterNonDominatedSorting.java"
in this repository.

This project compiled standalone (i.e. no dependencies, no Scala
required) with simplified Java API is available at:
