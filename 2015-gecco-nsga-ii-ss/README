This is the source code for experiments from papers:

==============================================================================

   Fast Implementation of Steady-State NSGA-II Algorithm for Two Dimensions
              Based on Incremental Non-Dominated Sorting

(accepted to GECCO Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization)
==============================================================================

               Various Degrees of Steadiness in NSGA-II
             and Their Influence on the Quality of Results

(accepted to GECCO Late Breaking Abstracts)
==============================================================================

Usage:

- ./r.sh paper-nsga
    Runs experiments and builds tables for the "Fast Implementation" paper.

- ./r.sh paper-steadiness
    Runs experiments and builds tables for the "Various Degrees" paper.

- all other usages are explained in the usage message
  (run r.sh without arguments)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Software requirements ([!] - mandatory, [.] - optional):

[!] Java 8        - for running experiments.
[.] Bash          - for r.sh to work. You may use contents of r.sh to compile
                    and run experiments in the way you like if you don't have
                    Bash.
[.] Scala 2.11    - for building LaTeX tables just as in papers.
                    Output is already human-readable, so it is not mandatory.
[.] R             - for evaluating results from "Various Degrees"
                    for statistical significance.
